title: Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control
date: 08-18-2025
description: Machine learning offers a powerful avenue for improving noisy quantum devices.  This work introduces a convolutional neural network that learns the disorder landscape of a disordered extended Hubbard model directly from charge-stability diagrams.  By processing site-specific disorder in hopping terms, on-site potentials and Coulomb interactions simultaneously, the network predicts disorder parameters with very high accuracy and reduces the number of constraints compared with previous approaches.  The method enables automated tuning of five or more quantum dots and mitigates crosstalk between device parameters.

Machine learning offers a powerful avenue for improving noisy quantum devices.  This work introduces a convolutional neural network that learns the disorder landscape of a disordered extended Hubbard model directly from charge-stability diagrams.  By processing site-specific disorder in hopping terms, on-site potentials and Coulomb interactions simultaneously, the network predicts disorder parameters with very high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.994) and reduces the number of constraints compared with previous approaches.  The method enables automated tuning of five or more quantum dots and mitigates crosstalk between device parameters.
